# Dogecoin Conversion

The script

1. logs in to dogevault.com
2. reads your balance
3. converts your Dogecoins to EUR on coinmill.com
4. outputs its results

```bash
casperjs vault.coffee --ssl-protocol=any
```

Output looks like `7569.73158839 Ɖ ~ 5.98 €` and might be useful for scripting.

Such Scrape.
Many Dogecoin.
Very automate.
Wow.
